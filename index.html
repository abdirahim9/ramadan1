      <p>Surely the month of Ramadan has come to you greeting its greetings,adding over to its dignified dignity and from its beauty a glory for the faster.Ramadan has come to you bearing its hunger and thirst.You see the food before you,your soul desires it,your hands reach it but you cannot eat it.The thrst inflames your abdomens,the water surrounds you,but you are not able to fetch it for the All-Knowing is watching.The drowsiness take your control, the sleep caresses your eyelids and Ramadan comes to wake you for Suhoor. It is a sequence of episodes of patience and self control and the Messenger of Allah Peace Be Upon Him was righteous when he said; <em>"And Fasting is half patience,and purity is half faith"</em>
      </p><h3>BENIFITS OF FASTING.</h3><p>Besides its spiritual and devotional aspects and purposes in Islam, fasting provides the human being with health benefits, it helps the body to put up toxins and get rid of damaged cells, which increases the body's health and strength rather than unhealthiness and weakness as is common among some people. Fasting also helps in reducing the ratio of fats and blood sugar, it strengths the immune system, and promotes healthy eating habits as well.

Doctors and researchers confirm that the human body is exposed to toxins found in the air, water and unhealthy food. Over the years the body accumulate these toxins in large amounts and becomes unable to get rid of them, and consequently the human being feels weak and confused. In this case fasting is the perfect solution, because the regular refrain from eating and drinking contributes to get rid of those toxins, and helps clean the body of impurities and waste.

Fasting also improves the digestive system functions which allows it to get important periods of rest. Thus, levels of energy production gradually rise, so the body can maintain fluids balance and stabilize foods digestion rates.

Nutritionists also indicates that fasting helps to reduce the amount of calories per day, and helps the body to eliminate excess fats, toxins and damaged tissues, and therefore enables the fasting person to lose weight and to gain a healthy body, subject to compliance with Ramadan’s health conditions such as eating less, exercising more, and avoiding excessive sleeping and laziness.
         Glory to Allah (SWT), who has legislated the month of Ramadan and has ordained us to fast and accomplish Qiyam, blessed is he who knows its worth and harvests its spiritual fruits. Raja Bin Haiwah narrated that Abu Umamah said: “I came to the Messenger of Allah {S.A.W} and said: Tell me of something that I may take (learn) from you. He said: Take to fasting, for there is nothing like it". The Prophet (pbuh) said as narrated by Tabarani: “Fast and you will be healthy”.</p>
